## Project proposal

Since I get around by bike, I recognized how many damages can be found in the 
cities infrastructure. Holes in streets, bycicle lanes, sidewalks or missing or
damaged street signs. For cyclists this can be life threatening.

The aim of this project is to make those damages transparent and document 
progress or decay.

Main component is a webapp to be used on a capable smartphone. It allows to enter
the location, categorize the kind of damage and upload a photo.
